# // Today:

A very simple todo app built with Electron and Vue.js

Today can currently:

- Read todos
- Add a new todo
- Complete a todo
- Delete a todo

I've got a few features planned for the future and I am still getting my head around Electron and Vue so hope to grow this app into something really useful over time. To name a few early features planned:

- Option desciption for a todo
- Date the todo was created
- Sort todos
- Warnings etc for stale todos
- Organise todos into day created sections

[This awesome tutorial](https://codeburst.io/build-a-todo-app-with-electron-d6c61f58b55a) on which this app is based and the [base Electron boilerplate](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

For letting me use his cool GitHub release packaging script and helping me with endless Electron/Vue queries!

[I wrote an article](https://jamesbateson.co.uk/articles/building-a-simple-todo-app-with-vue-js/) on setting up a basic todo list with Vue.js

I'll be putting together a more in-depth article including how I went about intergrating Electron with Vue and then publishing my first release.
