# todo-app
A play around with/intro to Electron. I've also never really found a todo app that I keep up to date and that I really like. So hopefully I can make this into one.

I am following this [awesome tutorial](https://codeburst.io/build-a-todo-app-with-electron-d6c61f58b55a) to make the basic app, which uses this base [Electron boilerplate](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).
